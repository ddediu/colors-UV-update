# colors-UV-update

This is a replication and extension of Josserand et al (2021)'s main finding, namely that UV-B incidence has a negative effect on the probability that a language has a specific word for 'blue'.
The focus is on extending the database so we have a much better world-wide coverage, in particular of Australia, PNG and Oceania, and on applying phylogenetic methods.
