# colors-UV-update

This is an extension of [Josserand et al (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98550-3)'s main finding, namely that UV-B incidence has a negative effect on the probability that a language has a specific word for 'blue'.
The focus is on extending the database so we have a much better world-wide coverage, in particular of Australia, PNG and Oceania, and on applying phylogenetic methods, piecewise and latent variables structural equation models.
