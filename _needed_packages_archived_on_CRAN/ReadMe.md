# Packages needed but not on CRAN anymore

The following packages are **archived** on CRAN an need to be installed manually:

`scanstatistics` (from https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/scanstatistics/)
`reliaR` (needed by `scanstatistics`; from https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/reliaR/)
`Imap` (from https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/Imap/)

To make things easier (and reproducible) we also store the **source packages** here (at their highest version on the `CRAN` archive as of May 2022).

*N.B.* On macs, one might need to install `gfortran` (these might help: https://mac.r-project.org/tools/ and https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS).
