All information on this database is present in Josserand et al (2021), and we did not change this data in our analysis. 
More precisely, we obtained this database thanks to Lindsey and Brown, who very nicely accepted to share their database with us. Then, Emma Meeussen went carefully on all data and looked at dictionnaries to add some more populations. The list of all the dictionnaries used are present in her Master Thesis (see Meeussen, 2014).
