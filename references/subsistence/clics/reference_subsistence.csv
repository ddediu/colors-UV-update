The I nanwatan distinguish at least eight sub species of sago palm trees (suqf 'sago tree'). Dependent on the sub-species, sago trees take ten to twelve years to mature. As far as the production of sago flour is concerned, just before flowering (when the amount of starch in the sago tree is maximal), the men cut (suqf u- 'to cut down the sago tree') the tree after which they cut the trunk in a few big pieces called sow6to 'trunk part'. An average sow6to trunk part measures 2 metre. The number of people available to work determines the size and number of the trunk parts. Then the bark of the trunk parts must be removed (sow6to [qore- 'to remove bark from trunk parts') and the trunk parts opened.
