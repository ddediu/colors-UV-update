Homelands of the language family were found using the following procedure:
***

 - 1. If available, latitude and longitudes of languages families were retrieved using Wichmann et al (2010)'s paper.

 - 2. Then, some of the missing data was filled using Supplementary Materials from Josserand et al (2021)'s (see input_files folder in https://github.com/ddediu/colors-UV)

 - 3. The case of language isolates: we used the same glottocode for the language family (and the same latitude and longitude)

 - 4. Even after completing all these 3 steps, we still had some missing data. We obtain the latitude and longitude of the remaining glottocodes using different methods: 
see table "method_data_families.csv" in this folder for more information.
